Autistic Meme Generator (and required tools)

This isnt a very serious project right now so it is rather messy, and I dont expect anyone to use it.

Requires:
Pillow https://python-pillow.github.io/

Tools and Instructions:
randommeme.py
this is the main tool, it includes vague instructions and requires you to locate the folder containing templates, memes and the export location.

memelocationtool.py
this tool makes normal templates into usable templates, it will prompt you to input the upper lect corner of the memes location, and the same for the lower right.

templatetest.py
this tool is desinged to be used on the converted toemplates to test if they will work with the main tool, it is just the location testing part of the main tool on its own (and very bloated).
